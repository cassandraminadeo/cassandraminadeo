        <h1>Homework Three</h1>
        <h2> Prompt </h2>
        <p> Choose a specific online activist movement or campaign that interests you. It could be related
            to social justice, environmental issues, human rights, or any other relevant topic. Ensure that
            your chosen topic has a significant online presence and has garnered attention and
            engagement. For your homework post, discuss online activism briefly then describe this
            particular movement (their goals, etc.). Go on to analyze the role social media (online petitions,
            hashtags, sites) have for the movements and evaluate the impact these tools have on raising
            awareness, fostering dialogue, and creating change (for example, by highlighting successes). Be
            sure to provide links as needed.</p>
        <h2> Response </h2>
        <p> Activism that can be taken to the internet allows for such a successful widespread for the cause at hand. It can use 
            several media platforms to share the cause to mass populations around the world. This is so successful because the access 
            to internet is so much higher as everyday passes and allows for so many people to join the cause. The #Metoo movement has 
            taken the world by storm is the best way possible to empower so many women to feel the confidence and safety to come 
            forward about sexual assault. This movement made great prominence in 2019 that gave so many people the opportunity to 
            come forward about the experiences that they went through.  </p>

        <p> <i> The movement is credited with giving visibility to the scope of sexual violence within the United States and 
            across the world. It is also defined by a push for accountability, including examining power structures in the workplace 
            that had enabled misconduct, and, in some cases, renewed efforts to seek justice for survivors through criminal and civil 
            court systems. In the first year of the movement, numerous prominent men lost their jobs after they were publicly 
            accused of wrongdoing. (Brittain)</i></p>  
        
        <p> Social media has been a great way to engage many people in this movement and help provide involvement for anyone who so 
            chooses. Change.org is a website that dedicates petitions for causes either locally, nationally, or even globally. 
            Specifically for the #Metoo movement, there are so many petitions for people to sign to be apart of the change. 
            Petitions include: </p>

        <!-- Image placeholders -->
        <div class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="images/metoo1.jpg" alt="Image 1">

            <img src="images/metoo3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
            
        </div>

        <p> These petitions are just a few of thousands to spread the words of sexual abuse, sexual assault, and sexual violence. 
            The #Metoo movement has made so much progress on their popular hashtag alone. It allows for so many social media users 
            to share there story and have it in a place where the community can see and support. Social Media like Facebook, 
            Instagram, Reddit, etc. all allow for supporters of the movement to connect and meet people who may have similar stories. 
            This movement also pushes for accountability for those who have committed these mortifying crimes to face justice. </p>

            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <img src="images/metoo4.jpg" alt="Image 4">
            </div>   
            
            <div class="preview-container">
                <iframe src="https://metoomvmt.org" title="#Metoo Website"></iframe>
            </div>

        <p> The #Metoo movement also has their own website that allows for supporters to see how they are able to help and be apart 
            of work that is taking place. Their webpage gives the chance for people to donate to programs of their choosing that 
            includes, Programs for Survivors, Political Engagement, Amplify the Movement, Corporate Partnerships, and Growing Out 
            Global Network. They also help survivors and those who wish to support the cause join in marches and rallies. The #Metoo 
            movement gives so many women a voice that did not feel like they had prior, it allows for a safe space for individuals to 
            come forwards about the experiences they had suffered and has to deal with alone for so long. </p>
